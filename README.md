## Overview
This repository contains the project plan and implementation for developing a restaurant recommendation system for Marlborough, MA. The project is divided into five parts: problem setup, model specification, programming, solution, and client overview. Detailed information about each part is provided in the PDF file in this repository.

## Repository Contents
- **Excel Spreadsheet**: Contains tasks, completion times, per-hour costs, and persons responsible.
- **Directed Graph**: Visualizes task dependencies and critical path.
- **Python Code**: Implements the linear programming model using PuLP.
- **Gantt Charts**: Illustrates best-case, expected, and worst-case scenarios.
- **PDF File**: Provides a detailed overview of the project plan and implementation.

## Project Parts
1. **Problem Setup**: 
   - Task list with dependencies and time estimates.
   - Team roles and responsibilities.
   - Directed graph for task dependencies.

2. **Model Specification**: 
   - Linear programming model to minimize project duration.
   - Variables for task start and end times.
   - Constraints based on task dependencies.

3. **Programming**: 
   - Implementation using PuLP in `linear_programming.py`.

4. **Solution**: 
   - Solved using best-case, expected, and worst-case time estimates.
   - Critical path identification.
   - Gantt charts for each scenario.

5. **Client Overview**: 
   - Project cost and timeline estimates.
   - Potential for reduced timeline with additional contractors.
